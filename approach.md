## How I work
1. **Diagnose** — clarify outcomes, constraints, and risks through focused interviews and artifact review
2. **Design** — define target state, roadmap, governance, and metrics that your team can own
3. **Deliver** — establish delivery cadence, decisions, and controls with transparent reporting
4. **Adopt** — enable teams, measure results, and stabilize operations so improvements stick

## What you get
- Decision-ready options, not theoretical slideware
- Clear ownership, RACI, and meeting rhythms to unblock teams
- Playbooks for risk, change, and vendor management tailored to your environment
- Lightweight documentation so successors can sustain the work
