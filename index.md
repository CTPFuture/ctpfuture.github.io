## Digital transformation that ships
We help leaders turn strategy into execution across technology, process, and governance—without overcomplicating delivery.

### What we do
- Digital and IT strategy with execution-ready roadmaps
- Microsoft platform enablement (M365 / Power Platform)
- ERP and finance transformation (process, controls, operating rhythm)
- Vendor selection and implementation oversight
- Program and project leadership for complex change

### Engagement models
- **Advisory** (strategy, operating model, governance)
- **Fractional leadership** (steady cadence, delivery accountability)
- **Project delivery** (defined scope and outcomes)

### Next step
